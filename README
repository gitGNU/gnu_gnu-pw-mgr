If you are building this from the source repository sources,
you will need the following tools:

* autotools (autoconf, automake and libtool)
* autogen
* gnulib
* git

You also need the autogen sources installed into ~/ag/git-ag.
(A source module "scribble.[ch]" is pulled from there.)
Then, finally, you must run the "bootstrap" script.

If you are not certain what this all means, then please build
from a source tarball.
