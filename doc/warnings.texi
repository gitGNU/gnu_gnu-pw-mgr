@node deficiencies
@section Cleanups that need doing

It is entirely possible that there are some web sites out there with
password requirements that this program cannot (at present) necessarily
comply with.  There are some possible workarounds:

@enumerate
@item
Request the addition of a new character classification flag.  If the issue
can be satisfied by fiddling the emitted password a little bit (with the
@code{--pbkdf2} option), that would be faster and easier than implementing
a new option.

@item
Likely, something else, surely.
Please send a bug report (preferably a patch :) so the issue can be fixed.

@node prying eyes
@section Shell history

It is imprudent to leave your invocations in your shell history.
These are often stored away in your home directory, unless you do
something to keep it out of your history.  It should not be the
end of the world because it is troublesome to also obtain the
configuration file.  Still, it is not wise to tempt fate.

If you use BASH for your shell,
@example
HISTCONTROL=ignorespace
HISTIGNORE=gnu-pw-mgr *:*/gnu-pw-mgr *
unset HISTFILE
@end example
are your friends.  Press the space bar before the command name,
or specify that anything that looks like a ``gnu-pw-mgr'' command should
be ignored or eliminate history entirely.

Also, if you put your password id's on the command line, they become part
of the process history and can be found.  If that is a conceivable problem,
then you may prefer to not put it on the command line and then type
it in in response to a prompt.  Your password id will not be echoed
back as you type it.

@node best pratcices
@section Best gnu-pw-mgr practices

Try out several password id transforms before changing all your passwords
on all your sites.  You may decide it is too hard or too easy and want
to change it.  However, once you have gone to the trouble of changing the
passwords on a lot of sites, you won't be especially eager to do it again.
So, play with it on one site you use a lot, change the password a lot as
you change the transform and then make a good decision.

Once you need to or are required to change a password, add another seed
to your configuration file.  Henceforth, you will be presented two
passwords.  If you have updated your password, use the more recent
one.  (That is what @xref{gnu-pw-mgr seed-options,the tags are for}.)
Otherwise, login with the old password and update to the new one.
Eventually, you should be able to retire the old seed.

When choosing your password id transform, use things that you can easily
remember.  Especially if some nonsense thing can be easily remembered.
Separate the components with unusual things like multiple punctuation
characters.  Do odd things with the top level domain.  cApitaliZe strangely.
Use a slightly different transform for financial institutions.
If someone gets ahold of your seed file, you want to hope that a
dictionary attack will not be readily successful.

But lastly and most important: be sure you can remember your transform(s).
If you forget, your password is gone.  So choose what you can remember
and be consistent.

@node password resets
@section Password reset arrangements

Some sites will allow you to set up password resets using alternate channels
(i.e. not your primary email address).  Take advantage of this whenever
possible.  If someone gains access to your email, you don't want them to reset
all your passwords, intercept the restore access emails and, thus, gain access
to all your password protected accounts.
