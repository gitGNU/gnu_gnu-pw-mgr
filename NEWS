New in 1.2 - March 2014

* New option:  selection of password characters (--select-chars)
  There is a bank on this planet that requires you to enter
  specific characters from your password -- not the entire thing.

* When reading in password id's from stdin, allow the stdin/out
  to be non-terminals so this program can be used as a web page
  service.

New in 1.1 - January 2014

* a --status option will display the status of a password id.
  This will only tell you if there are special password attributes.

* passwords can require two characters from one class.
  This can now be specified for upper case letters, lower case
  letters, digits and special characters (punctuation).
  This is not supported for either "two of any alpha" or "two of
  any alphanumeric".

New in 1.0 - November 2013

* This is a new project
