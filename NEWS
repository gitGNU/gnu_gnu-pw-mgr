New in 1.1 - December 2013

* a --status option will display the status of a password id.
  This will only tell you if there are special password attributes.

* passwords can require two characters from one class.
  This can now be specified for upper case letters, lower case
  letters, digits and special characters (punctuation).
  This is not supported for either "two of any alpha" or "two of
  any alphanumeric".

New in 1.0 - November 2013

* This is a new project
