New in 2.0 - May, 2016

* A new option --shared to implement sharing passwords.
  This allows shared logins with secure passwords and still
  keeps all the other passwords very secret.  See the docs for
  the rationale and usage.

New in 1.6 - October, 2015

* A fix for security questions.  They are too hard to remember,
  consistent from web site to web site.  A "--confirm" option
  has been added to provide secure, site unique answers to
  these questions.

New in 1.5 - August, 2015

* PIN number passwords got broken somewhere along the line.
  Nobody much uses tham.  (A good thing.)

New in 1.4 - April, 2015

* sort-pw-cfg: a sort/merge program for combining and organizing
  configurations.

* --delete: a new option to remove any entries for a password id
